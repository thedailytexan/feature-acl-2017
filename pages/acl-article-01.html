    <div class="content">
      <p>If you had reservations about donating a kidney to get ACL passes, don’t fret! There are plenty of great activities to enjoy during both ACL weekends at a cheaper price. Here are five events that you can hit up outside of Zilker.</p>

      <h1>The German-Texas Heritage Society’s Oktoberfest</h1>
      <p>
        Get your taste of Germany at the German-Texas Heritage Society’s Oktoberfest. The party provides family fun with live music, games, German food courtesy of caterers at Frank Sausages and, of course, beer. Not only is this an alternative to ACL, it’s a cheaper and more easily accessible beer festival for Austinites than Fredericksburg’s annual Oktoberfest.
      </p>
      <p>When: Saturday, Oct. 14, 11 a.m.-7 p.m.</p>
      <p>Where: The German Free School</p>
      <p>Admission: Adults $7, children 12 and under free</p>
      <p>Why: Beer</p> 
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h1>Free Karaoke at Ego’s</h1>
      <p>Instead of listening to a weekend’s worth of ACL artists, you can take to the stage yourself and sing your favorite tunes at Ego’s, one of Austin’s best karaoke bars. Hit up this Austin gem early to reserve your spot at the mic and sing your heart out before a heckle-free crowd. While waiting to sing, check out the pool tables and pinball to keep up the fun.</p>
      <p>When: Weeknights, 9 p.m.-2 a.m.</p>
      <p>Where: Ego’s Bar</p>
      <p>Admission: Adults 21+, karaoke free, menu prices vary</p>
      <p>Why: The sweet, sweet sound of drunk people who can’t sing</p> 
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h1>Austin Uptown Dance Free Dance Classes</h1>
      <p>Start your journey to become the next Beyonce with Austin Uptown Dance’s free dance classes for beginners in two step, swing and salsa. This event will be a great way to pick up a new skill and meet new people while having relaxed, healthy fun.</p>
